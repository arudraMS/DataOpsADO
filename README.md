# DataOps for the Modern Lakehouse

This repository contains code samples and artifacts on how to apply DevOps principles to data pipelines built according to the [Modern Data Warehouse (MDW)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/solutions/architecture/modern-data-warehouse/) architectural pattern on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/).

The samples are either focused on a single azure service (**Single Tech Samples**) or showcases an end to end data pipeline solution as a reference implementation (**End to End Samples**). Each sample contains code and artifacts relating one or more of the following

- Infrastructure & Data Pipelines as Code (IaC)
- Build and Release Pipelines (CI/CD)
- Testing
- Observability / Monitoring

## End to End samples
- **Parking Sensor Solution** - This demonstrates batch, end-to-end data pipeline following the MDW architecture, along with a corresponding CI/CD process.
